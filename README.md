# Clothes Category Classificaton

## Main goal
The objective is to train and evaluate ML model, which will be tasked with classifying clothes based on photos, intoto one of the following classes, which divide clothing by age and gender:
- Woman
- Man
- Gril
- Boy
- Baby

When we talk about clothes, we mean the basic parts of the upper and lower closet, such as: T-shirt, jacket, coat, sweater, pants, skirt, dress, etc. We do not consider accessories, footwear, headwear or underwear. If there are no clothes in the picture or there are many clothes, the behavior of the system will be undefined. We expect that the input data will be photos showing: unfolded, mostly hanging clothes, forming the central part of the image, which are fully visible. Hence, other types of photos will also be able to cause undefined system behavior, such as when clothes are on someone.

## Dataset
Photos collected with their own hands by team members with their phones (photos of clothes in their own homes and in stores)
